Travel Agency Full Stack Web Application
Architecture
Frontend Development:
In this project, we utilized Express for handling server-side logic, HTML for structuring web pages, and JavaScript for client-side interactivity. Additionally, we implemented a single-page application (SPA) architecture using frameworks like Angular to enhance user experience and reduce server load by dynamically updating content.

Backend Database:
The backend utilized a NoSQL MongoDB database for its flexibility and scalability. Since our data model may evolve over time and include nested structures, a document-oriented database like MongoDB allows for seamless schema modifications without downtime.

Functionality
JSON vs. JavaScript:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format inspired by JavaScript object literal syntax. It serves as a universal data format for communication between frontend and backend systems. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a programming language used for implementing dynamic behavior on web pages. JSON ties together frontend and backend development by providing a standardized format for exchanging data, enabling seamless communication between different layers of the application.

Code Refactoring:
Throughout the development process, we refactored code to enhance functionality and efficiency. By modularizing code into reusable UI components, we improved maintainability and scalability. Reusable components reduce redundancy and make it easier to implement consistent design patterns across the application. This not only streamlines development but also enhances user experience by ensuring a cohesive interface.

Testing
API Testing:
Testing methods for request and retrieval involve various types of API testing to ensure endpoint functionality and data integrity. This includes unit testing individual endpoints to verify correct behavior, integration testing to validate interactions between components, and end-to-end testing to simulate user journeys. Additionally, testing with added security layers involves assessing vulnerabilities such as injection attacks and authentication bypasses to safeguard against potential threats.
